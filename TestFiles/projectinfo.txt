A QR-based vehicle verification and notification system for RTO (Regional Transport Office) is a modern digital solution designed to improve how vehicle-related information is accessed and managed. Here's a breakdown of what it is and how it works:

üöó What It Is:
A QR-based vehicle verification system involves attaching a QR code (Quick Response code) to a vehicle‚Äîusually on the windshield or number plate. This QR code is linked to the vehicle's official data stored in the RTO database.

üì± How It Works:
QR Code Generation:

When a vehicle is registered at the RTO, a unique QR code is generated and linked to the vehicle‚Äôs details.

QR Code Placement:

The code is affixed to the vehicle, usually inside the windshield or on the number plate.

Verification via Scanning:

Police, RTO officers, or authorized personnel can scan the QR code using a mobile app or device.

Upon scanning, they instantly access key details like:

Owner‚Äôs name

Vehicle registration number

Insurance status

PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate

Fitness certificate

Road tax status

Any violations or challans
